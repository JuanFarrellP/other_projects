Description: 
This project is an assignment for MA4251 Coding Theory at Bandung Institute of Technology based on Coding Theory: A First Course (2004) by San Ling and Chaoping Xing. 

The main tasks of this project are as follows:
1. Perform Algorithm 4.1 (page 49) and Algorithm 4.2 (page 50) to obtain the basis of a linear code.
2. Perform Algorithm 4.3 (page 50) to obtain the dual basis of a linear code.
3. Encode (page 57) a codeword and then decode (page 59) it with the freedom to alter the sent codeword.

How to run the program:
1. Unzip Coding_Theory_Project_10119047_10119056.rar.
2. Open the Coding_Theory_Project_10119047_10119056 folder.
3. Run Coding_Theory_Project.exe.
